Recursively sets tags for the subdirectories below the one given at the command line.
Required: pytagger. Get it from http://www.liquidx.net/pytagger/, 
Required: PYTHON2.7
To run: Either use 'crunch.py' --help to see the command line parameters, or 'crunchGUI.py' for the interactive version.
Alternatively, if you're running Win7 32bit, the installer from my website: http://adini.me/static/MP3Crunch_0.3_win32.exe


TODO: Handle old version of ID3 tags (where there's no TALB frame)
