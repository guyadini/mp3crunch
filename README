Recursively sets tags for the subdirectories below the one given at command line.
Required: pytagger. Get it from http://www.liquidx.net/pytagger/
To run: 1. Try it, see that it works on your filesystem and prints the desired results
		2. change 'convertTags' to True (in line 100), and run again. This will actually change the tags on your mp3s.
(this whole mess will be fixed in the next version).
